## Overview

ASTRA introduces a deep learning-based framework to assess the sensitivity of radiotherapy dose predictions to local variations in organ-at-risk (OAR) segmentations. By simulating atomic surface transformations, ASTRA provides clinicians with dose-aware sensitivity maps, highlighting regions where segmentation inaccuracies could significantly impact dose distributions.

---

## Key Contributions

- **Dose-Aware Sensitivity Mapping:** ASTRA predicts the potential impact of local segmentation variations on radiotherapy dose distributions, aiding in quality assurance.
- **Simulation of Segmentation Variability:** Introduces a method to simulate realistic local perturbations in OAR contours, reflecting inter-observer variability.
- **Clinical Applicability:** Demonstrated the utility of ASTRA in identifying critical regions in OARs susceptible to dose changes, facilitating informed decision-making in treatment planning.

---

## Methodology

- **Data:** Utilized a dataset of 100 glioblastoma patients, including CT scans, OAR segmentations, and corresponding dose distributions.
- **Perturbation Techniques:** Applied atomic surface transformations to OAR contours to simulate local segmentation variability.
- **Model Architecture:** Employed convolutional neural networks to predict dose sensitivity maps based on perturbed segmentations.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Dose-Volume Histogram (DVH) differences.
